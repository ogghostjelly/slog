            <a href="install-nixos.html">Installing NixOS impermanence with LUKS</a>
            <p>
                I enumerate how I setup my NixOS impermanence setup on a VM using LUKS disk encryption.
                It uses ext4 for both the persistent and ephemeral storage and erases the ephemeral
                storage on reboot.

            if anyone knows a good <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr> that is highly customizable and allows
            full control over the generated output; please tell me at
            <a href="mailto:johnnycambodia09@gmail.com">&lt;johnnycambodia09@gmail.com&gt;</a>. I'm so tired
            of writing HTML by hand but I don't want to touch any bLaZiNgLy fAsT js framework with a 5 foot pole and all
            the other
            <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr>s are too invasive and force me to "do it their way". Also I
            need markdown preprocessing and SHTML (the one I made not SSI) doesn't have that... I. Don't. Want. To.
            Write. HTML.
            Please. Help.
            Me.
